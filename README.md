# 2048game
This is a 2048game.
2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
The game begins with two tiles already in the grid, having a value of either 2 or 4, and another such tile appears in a random empty space after each turn.

HOW TO PLAY: 
--> Use your arrow keys or swipe left or right, up or down to move the tiles. 
--> When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. Once you get 2048 in any square, you win.
